Short bio
======

I'm a research associate & PhD candidate working on 3D semantic reconstruction & segmentation of point clouds at the [Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing Chair](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/pf/home/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). 
I pursue my PhD under the mentorship of [Prof Thomas Kolbe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fHuIr30AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and late [Prof Uwe Stilla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M3beNHEAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my Geodesy and Geoinformatics master's degree from [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) with a major in photogrammetry. I was fortunate to intern and complete my master's thesis at [Audi AG](https://www.audi.com/de/company.html) and had a previous stint as a geomatics professional in a 3D GIS-focused company.

**Research interests**: 3D semantic reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, 3D building models, 3D virtual testbeds for automated driving, mobile mapping, urban digital twins
